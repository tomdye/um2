	<h3>Turning Cookies Off</h3>

	<p>You can usually switch cookies off by adjusting your browser settings to stop it from accepting cookies (Learn how <a href=" http://www.attacat.co.uk/resources/cookies/how-to-ban">here</a>).  Doing so however will likely limit the functionality of our's and a large proportion of the world's websites as cookies are a standard part of most modern websites</p>
	<p>It may be that you concerns around cookies relate to so called "spyware".  Rather than switching off cookies in your browser you may find that anti-spyware software achieves the same objective by automatically deleting cookies considered to be invasive.
